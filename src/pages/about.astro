		Hey there! I’m Akshay Sinha, a DevOps enthusiast with 17+ years of experience turning complex tech challenges into smooth, automated solutions. I specialize in cloud transformations, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation—and I love diving into freelance projects that need a strategic touch.
	</p>

	<p>
		Over the years, I’ve led large-scale IT initiatives across India, the UK, and the US, working with tools like Kafka, Cloudant, WebSphere, and more. One of my proudest moments? Rolling out CI/CD pipelines at Universal Orlando (via HCL Technologies) that turbocharged delivery and efficiency.
	</p>

	<p>
		I’m also big on writing technical articles and solving problems through smart tech and innovation. Whether it’s building high-availability systems or mentoring teams, I’m all about creating scalable, secure, and user-friendly solutions.
